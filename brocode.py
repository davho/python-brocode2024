# # Make sure Python, Python extension for VS Code and package installer for Python, aka `pip`, are installed (note, pip/pip3 was not installed at the time of archiving this course):
# # `python3 --version`
# # `pip3 --version`

# # To run the script in Terminal do `python3 brocode.py`

# # To study any lesson in this course simple comment out the lesson and run the script

# # In the comments, the lesson concepts are Capitalized and the names of Variables, Functions, Methods, Classes, Subclasses, Packages, Modules and Submodules are flanked with backticks, e.g. `variable_name`, `function_name`, as well as various Operators, e.g. `|`, `or`, `and`, and code snippets and structural demonstrations are also flanked with the `code` Markdown syntax, e.g. do `python3 <file-name>.py`, `age = int(input('How old are you?: '))`, `[start:end:step]`, `[ expression for element in iterable if condition ]`




# # Intro - 00:00:00

# # From Terminal run Python files with `python3 <file-name>.py`

# # `print` is the Python equivalent of `console.log` in JavaScript
# print('I')
# print('like')
# print('pizza')




# # Variables - 00:05:49

# # Variable = A container for a value. It behaves as if it were the value it contains. It isn't declared with `var`, `let` or `const`, as would be the case in JavaScript. The term "primitive data types" isn't used in Python either but it generally refers to the built-in data types that represent single values: Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans.

# # Strings (regular Strings)
# first_name = 'Bro'
# food = 'pizza'
# email = '123@abc.io'
# ageAsStr = '25'
# emptyStr = ''

# # Integers
# ageAsInt = 25
# quantity = 3
# num_of_students = 30 # Underscores separating words that comprise Variable names is the naming convention in Python as opposed to camelCase in JavaScript

# # Float
# price = 10.99
# gpa = 3.2
# distance = 5.5

# # Boolean
# is_student = True # `True` and `False` must have their T and F capitalized
# is_for_sale = False
# is_online = True

# print(first_name)
# print(food)
# print(email)

# # F-Strings (Formatted Strings) = The Python equivalent of template Strings in JavaScript. Variables in the Formatted Strings don't need the dollar sign to signify them. The quotes can be single or double but not backtick.

# print(f'Hello {first_name}')
# print(f'You like {food}')
# print(f'Your email is {email}')
# print(f'You are {ageAsStr} years old. {ageAsInt} is an anxious time.') # Integers parse fine within Strings
# print(f'Your class has {num_of_students} students')
# print(f'The price is ${10.99}') # Dollar sign appears in the text and is not used to signify use of the Variable in the F-String
# print(f'Your GPA is {gpa}')
# print(f'You ran {distance}km')

# if (is_student):
#     print('You are a student')
# else:
#     print('You are not a student')

# if (is_for_sale):
#     print('This item is for sale')
# else:
#     print('This item is not for sale')

# if (is_online):
#     print('You are online')
# else:
#     print('You are not online')




# # Type Casting - 00:16:05

# # Type Casting = The process of converting a Variable from one data type to another.
# # `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` are Functions each which eponymously convert the Arguments passed to them.

# ageAsInt = 25
# ageAsStr = '25'
# price = 10.99
# is_online = True
# emptyStr = ''

# print(type(ageAsInt))
# print(type(ageAsStr))
# print(type(price))
# print(type(is_online))

# print(ageAsInt == ageAsStr) # prints `False`
# print(ageAsInt == int(ageAsStr)) # prints `True`

# print(bool(ageAsStr)) # All actual Strings are `True`...
# print(bool(emptyStr)) # ...but empty Strings are `False`




# # User Input - 00:21:15

# # `input` = A Function that takes a String to prompt the user to enter data and returns the entered data as a String.

# name = input('What is your name?: ')
# age = input('How old are you?: ')
# age_next_year = int(age) + 1 # To do arithmetic with the user input, which is a String, we must first Type Cast it to an Integer or to a Float. And since Integers can be passed into the String we could even have converted the age immediately to an Integer by doing `age = int(input('How old are you?: '))`
# print(f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old. Next year you will be {age_next_year}.')




# # Rectangle Area Calc Program - 00:26:14

# item = input('What item would you like to buy?: ')
# price = float(input('What is the price?: '))

# # Conditional Expressions - 01:21:28

# # Conditional Expression = A one-line shortcut for the "if else" Statement known as the Ternary Operator in JavaScript (as well as many other programming languages) which involves placing both `if` and `else` in the same line. It prints or assigns one of two values based on a condition and is structured "X if condition else Y".

# min_num = a if a < b else b

# print(max_num_nested_ternary_example)
# print(status_age)
# print(status_temperature)




# # String Methods - 01:27:03

# # `len` = Python Function that takes a String to return the number of characters in that String, i.e. the length of that String. It behaves like the `length` Property in JavaScript, but is not a Property of the String prototype like in JavaScript. Rather, it's a standalone Function in Python. Note, Python's `len` can technically be used with various types of Objects, not just Strings.
# # `find` = String Method in Python which returns the first match, same as JavaScript's `String.prototype.search`.
# # `rfind` = Stands for reverse find and finds the last match.
# # `capitalize` = Capitalizes the first letter of the String.
# # `upper` = Makes all the characters in the String uppercase.
# # `lower` = Makes all of the characters in the String lowercase.
# # `isdigit` = Returns a Boolean indicating if the String comprises only digits.
# # `isalpha` = Returns a Boolean indicating if the String comprises only alphabetic characters.

# # `count` = Returns the number of instances in the String of the String passed to it.
# # `replace` = Returns a new String with all instances in the String of the first Argument replaced with the second Argument.

# # `dir(str)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the names of the Methods available to and Attributes of Strings, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call `dir` on any Variable itself that is a String, i.e. `dir(string_variable)`.
# # `help(str)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the Methods available to and Attributes of Strings with information about them, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call `help` on any Variable itself that is a String, i.e. `help(string_variable)`.

# # String Indexing - 01:39:09

# # String Indexing = Accessing the elements of a sequence using `[]`, aka the Indexing Operator. The Indexing Operator can take up to 3 Arguments: The first Argument alone returns the character at that index, the first and second Arguments together return the section of the String from and inclusive of the starting index to and excluding the ending index, and the first second and third Arguments together return the String from and inclusive of the starting index to and excluding the ending index according to the step specified in the third Argument. The format for this is `[start:end:step]`.

# # List = [] ordered and changeable where duplicates are okay.
# # Set = {} unordered and immutable, but adding and removing are okay, however, no duplicates.
# # Tuple = () ordered and unchangeable, where duplicates are okay and it's faster performance wise.

# # `dir(list)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the names of the Methods available to and Attributes of a List, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call `dir` on any Variable itself that is a List, e.g. `dir(list_variable)`.
# # `help(list)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the Methods available to and Attributes of a List with information about it, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call it on any Variable itself that is a List, e.g. `help(list_variable)`.

# # `dir(set)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the names of the Methods available to and Attributes of a Set, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call `dir` on any Variable itself that is a Set, e.g. `dir(set_variable)`.

# print(fruits[1:3]) # Use the Index Operator to access a range of elements exclusive of the end

# print(fruits[::2]) # You can also only specify a step, knowing that the start and end defaults are the very beginning and very end of the List

# print(fruits[::-1]) # You can even go backwards with a negative value, again, same as String Indexing

# print(len(fruits)) # The `len` Function works on Lists the same way it does for Strings

# print('apple' in fruits) # The `in` Membership Operator returns a Boolean, in this case `True`

# fruits[2] = 'kiwi' # Same as Arrays in JavaScript you can reassign elements

# fruits.append('plum') # You can append elements

# fruits.remove('apple') # You can remove elements

# fruits.insert(3, 'fig') # You can insert elements at a designated location

# fruits.sort() # You can sort Lists, the default for which is alphabetical order, same as Arrays in JavaScript

# fruits.reverse() # You can reverse Lists, same as Arrays in JavaScript

# print(fruits.index('fig')) # You can get the index of an element

# fruits.append('fig') # You can append another fig because duplicates are okay in Lists

# print(fruits.count('fig')) # You can get the count of the specified element

# print(fruits.count('spinach')) # Getting the count of a specified element which doesn't exist will gracefully return 0 when the element is not present

# fruits.clear() # You can clear all the elements out of a List with the `clear` Method

For this reason you cannot use the Index Operator on a Set and you cannot change the value of a Set. You can, however, add and remove elements of a Set but you cannot add duplicates to a Set, though trying to do so will not throw an error, rather, will simply not affect the Set

# # Dictionaries - 3:03:26

# # Dictionary = A Collection of {key: value} pairs ordered and changeable, with no duplicates. They're like Objects in JavaScript but 1) with Dictionaries keys can be of any immutable type, e.g. Strings, numbers or Tuples, whereas in JavaScript keys are typically Strings, symbols or any valid JavaScript identifier. As long as they're not reserved keywords, keys don't need to be placed in quotes in JavaScript Objects, 2) JavaScript Objects can have prototypes, which means they can inherit Properties and Methods from their prototype chain whereas Dictionaries in Python do not have this concept of prototypes, 3) You can iterate over a Dictionary using a For Loop directly on the Dictionary which by default iterates over the Dictionary's keys whereas in JavaScript you have to use a Method like `Object.keys` to get an Array of keys, 4) You access the Property of an Object in JavaScript using dot notation, but with Python Dictionaries you use square brackets to access the values for keys, the same way you do to access elements in ordered Collections i.e. Lists and Tuples, or the `get` Method on Dictionaries, to which you can also provide a default value if a key doesn't exist.

# # `dir(dict)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the names of the Methods available to and Attributes of Dictionaries, which you can then log with `print`. You can also call `dir` on any Variable itself that is a Dictionary, e.g. `dir(tuple_variable)`.
# # `help(dict)` = Returns a comprehensive list of all the Methods available to and Attributes of Dictionaries with information about them, which you can then log with `print` You can also call `dir` on any Variable itself that is a Dictionary, e.g. `help(tuple_variable)`.

#               'Russia': 'Moscow'
#             } # Whitespace is ok in defining Dictionaries to get key:value pairs to line up

# print(capitols.get('USA')) # This will return "Washington D.C"

# print(capitols.get('Japan')) # This will return `None`, which is a reserved word in Python similar to `undefined` or `null` in JavaScript but with some slight differences, which is useful for `if` Statements

# if capitols.get('Japan'):
#     print('That capitol exists')
# else:
#     print('That capitol doesn\'t exist') # This `else` block should print accordingly

# capitols.update({'Germany': 'Berlin'}) # Using the `update` Method we can add a new key:value pair or `update` an existing key:value pair

# print(capitols) # This will print the capitols Dictionary but include the 'Germany': 'Berlin' key:value pair because capitols has been updated with it

# capitols.update({'USA': 'Detroit'}) # This is an example of changing an existing key:value pair

# print(capitols) # So this will print the capitols Dictionary but include the 'USA': 'Detroit' key:value pair because capitols has been updated with it

# capitols.pop('China') # The `pop` Method removes the key:value pair of the specified key

# print(capitols) # So this will print the capitols Dictionary without the 'China': 'Beijing' key:value pair

# capitols.popitem() # This removes the last key:value in the Dictionary

# print(capitols) # So in this case the 'Germany': 'Berlin' key:value pair will be gone

# print(capitols.keys()) # This returns all the keys of a Dictionary and presents them as if they're in a List, but technically they're in a View Object (yes, an Object, not Dictionary)

# for key in capitols.keys(): # You can iterate over specifically the keys
#     print(key)

# for key_value in capitols: # You can iterate over just the Dictionary but it will still automatically isolate the keys, even through the elements we're identifying in the Dictionary are the key_value pairs themselves
#     print(key_value)

# for value in capitols.values(): # To isolate the values use the `values` Method

# for item in capitols.items(): # If formatting isn't an issue you can simply use the `items` Method directly, which returns a Dictionary Object which resembles a 2D List of Tuples

# # Functions - 3:52:11

# # Function = A block of reusable code which can take Arguments in a `()` prefaced with the word `def` which, to invoke, you place the `()` containing the Arguments after its name, identically to JavaScript.

# # `return` = A Statement used to end a Function and send a result back to the place from which the Function was invoked.

# # There are 4 types of Function Arguments: 1. Positional Arguments, 2. Default Arguments, 3. Keyword Arguments, and 4) Arbitrary Arguments.

# # Positional Arguments = During a Function call, Arguments passed to the Function in the order the Function expects the Arguments.

# # Default Arguments = In a Function definition, Arguments with a default value which are used if no Argument is passed during the Function call.

# # Keyword Arguments = During a Function call, Arguments passed to the Function with the Argument name.

# # Arbitrary Arguments = In a Function definition, an Argument prefixed with an asterisk, `*`, which allows the Function to accept any number of Arguments (this is also known as a Variadic Functions). The standard convention is to call this Argument `*args` in the case of Arbitrary Positional Arguments, and `**kwargs` in the case of Arbitrary Keyword Arguments.

# def happy_birthday(name, age): # Define a Function called `happy_birthday`
#     print(f'‚ô¨ Happy birthday to {name} ‚ô´')
#     print(f'‚ô™ Happy birthday to {name} ‚ô©')
#     print(f'‚ô¨ Happy birthday dear {name} ‚ô´')
#     print(f'‚ô¨ Happy birthday to {name} ‚ô´')
#     print(f'‚ô¨ You\'re {age} years old ‚ô´')
#     print(f'‚ô™ You\'re {age} years old ‚ô©')
#     print(f'‚ô¨ You\'re {age} years old ‚ô´')
#     print(f'‚ô™ You\'re {age} years old ‚ô©')

# Call the happy_birthday Function several times passing it different Arguments each time
# happy_birthday('Bro', 20)
# happy_birthday('Steve', 30)
# happy_birthday('Joe', 40)

# def display_invoice(username, amount, due_date): # Define a Function called `display_invoice`
#     print(f'Hello {username}')
#     print(f'Your bill of {amount:.2f} is due on {due_date}')

# Call the display_invoice Function a couple times passing it different Arguments each time
# display_invoice('Bro', 42.50, 'Jan 1st')
# display_invoice('Joe', 100.01, 'Feb 2nd')

# # Default Arguments - 4:02:51

# # Default Arguments = A default value for certain Parameters in a Function, same as in JavaScript, which make your Functions more flexible and reduce the number of Arguments which must be passed, i.e. nothing needs to be passed solely as a placeholder.

# def net_price(list_price, discount=0, tax=0.05): # Here we want a default value for `discount` because sometimes there isn't one, and a default value for `tax` because it's usually 0.05
#     return f'{list_price * (1 - discount) * (1 + tax):.2f}'

# price_in_jurisdiction_b = net_price(500) # Passing just one Argument like this will pass 500 as `list_price` but use the default values for the `discount` and `tax` Arguments

# price_in_jurisdiction_a = net_price(500, .1, .08) # Passing all three Arguments like this will pass 500 as `list_price`, .1 as `discount` and .08 as `tax`

# price_in_jurisdiction_c = net_price(700, .075, .15) # Passing all three Arguments like this will pass 700 as `list_price`, .075 as `discount` and .15 as `tax`

# print(price_in_jurisdiction_a)
# print(price_in_jurisdiction_b)
# print(price_in_jurisdiction_c)


# import time

# def count(end, start=0): # Default Arguments must follow non-Default Arguments in a Function definition, so `start=0` must be at the end of the Arguments
#     for x in range(start, end + 1):
#         print(x)
#         time.sleep(1)
#     print('Done!')

# print(count(4))

# print(count(5, 1))




# # Positional Arguments and Keyword Arguments - 4:08:56

# # Positional Argument = An Argument passed to a Function in the order the Function expects it.

# # Keyword Argument = An Argument preceded by an identifier when passed to a Function, which helps with readability and makes the order of Arguments not matter in a Function call.

# def hello(greeting, title, first, last):
#     print(f'{greeting} {title} {first} {last}')

# print(hello('Hello', 'Mr.,', 'John', 'Smith')) # This is a call to the `hello` Function using Positional Arguments

# print(hello(last='Smith', title='Mr.', greeting='Hello', first='John')) # This is a call to the `hello` Function using Keyword Arguments showing that they can be in any order

# print(hello('Hello', last='Smith', first='John', title='Mr.')) # If you're mixing and matching Positional Arguments and Keyword Arguments in your call to a Function you have to make sure the Positional Arguments come first

# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x, end=' ') # `end` is a Keyword Argument found within Python's built-in `print` Method

# print(1,2,3,4,5,6,sep=' is less than ') # `sep`, which stands for separate, is also a Keyword Argument found within Python's built-in `print` Method


# def get_phone(first_few_digits, last_few_digits, country=1, area=123): # This Function has Default Arguments for `country` and `area`, expecting that it will mostly be used for U.S. numbers
#     return (f'{country}-{area}-{first_few_digits}-{last_few_digits}')

# phone_num = get_phone(456, country=55, area=123, last_few_digits=7890) # If you're mixing and matching Positional Arguments and Keyword Arguments in your call to a Function you have to make sure the Positional Arguments come first

# print(phone_num)




# # Arbitrary Arguments - 4:15:42

# # Arbitrary Arguments = They allow you to pass multiple Positional Arguments as a single Argument packed into a Tuple and prefixed with `*`, which is the non-Keyword Argument Unpacking Operator, and to pass multiple Keyword Arguments packed into a Dictionary and prefixed with `**` which is the Keyword Argument Unpacking Operator.

# def add_two_nums(a, b): # This `add_two_nums` Function only takes two Arguments
#     return a + b

# print(add(1, 2))

# def add_any(*nums): # This `add_any` Function takes an unspecified number of Arbitrary Arguments
#     print(type(nums)) # Printing how this `add_any` Function interprets these Arbitrary Arguments demonstrates that it interprets them as a Tuple

# # Modules - 5:02:14

# # Module = A file containing code you want to include in your program which you use the `import` keyword to reference. A Module can be built into Python, downloaded from a library or be built within and for the project itself. It's useful for breaking up a large program into reusable, separate files, same as in JavaScript.

# # You can do `print(help('modules'))` to see the comprehensive list of Modules built into Python, and you can pass the name of the Module into the help Function to get the comprehensive list of all the Methods and Attributes of that particular Module with information about them, for instance `print(help('math'))`

# import math # Example importing a Module as itself
# import math as the_native_python_math_module # Example importing a Module as an alias, similar to how it can be done in JavaScript

# pi = the_native_python_math_module.pi # Accessing the Attributes and Methods of a Module is done with the dot notation same as in JavaScript

# print(pi)

# from math import pi # You can deliberately import only some of the Methods or Attributes from a Module, similar to how it can be done in JavaScript, like this

# print(pi)


# import example_module # Consider the `example_module` (which is in the same directory as this file). Unlike how it's done in JavaScript, Modules in Python are inherently exported, i.e. they don't need to have anything exported from them. Rather, everything in them is already available. Side note, even if there's no `help` Function included in a Module, as is the case with `example_module`, Python's built-in `help` Method even provides some useful info for it

# print(example_module.pi)
# print(example_module.square(6))
# print(example_module.cube(3))
# print(example_module.circumference(3))
# print(example_module.area(5))




# # Variable Scope and Scope Resolution - 5:08:50

# # Variable Scope = Where in a project or program a Variable is visible and accessible
# # Scope Resolution = LEGB Rule, i.e. Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built-in, which means that Python will first look for the Variable within the Local Scope, then any Enclosed Scope, then the Global Scope, and lastly the Built-in Scope. This means you can override Python's built-in Variables with your own Variables, which is obviously not recommended, but is possible.

# from math import pi # If you were to import `pi` from Python's native `math` Module...
# pi = 123 # ...you could overwrite it with a Global Variable...
# print(pi)

# def pi_printer(): # ...with an Enclosed Variable...
#     pi = 456
#     print(pi)

# pi_printer()

# def pi_printer(): # ...or with a Local Variable
#     pi = 456
#     def pi_printer_local():
#         pi = 789
#         print(pi)
#     pi_printer_local()

# # Main Guards aka Main Checks  - 5:14:23

# # Main Guard aka Main Check = A conditional Statement used to determine whether a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a Module into another script. It's able to do this because every Python Module has a special built-in Variable called `__name__`. When a Module is run directly the `__name__` Variable is set to '__main__'. When a Module is imported into another Module the `__name__` Variable is set to the Module's name. It's important to have in Python scripts because it leaves no Global Variables, i.e. avoids polluting the Global namespace, keeping the Global Scope clean and reducing the risk of Variable name conflicts, making the Module safer to import and use, and avoids unintended execution. The check is read "If Dunder name equals Dunder main" and is written `if __name__ == '__main__'`.

# # Imagine you have a Module called `my_module.py`...
# def primary(): # ...with a Function called `primary`...
#     print('This is the main function.')

# def secondary(): # ...and a Function called `secondary`...
#     print('This is a secondary function.')

# if __name__ == '__main__': # ...and you were to call the `primary` Function under the condition that Dunder name must equal Dunder main, if you were to do `python3 my_module.py` in Terminal you'd get the printed Statement "This is the main function", but if you were to import `my_module.py` into this file and do `python3 brocode.py` you'd get "This is the secondary function"
#     primary()
# else:
#     secondary()

Instead Python reads the entire script before running it, so it knows about all Global Variables regardless of where they are declared. However you must define Global Variables before using them in your code to avoid errors. If a Global Variable is used in the main Function the main Function call must come after the Variable is defined. So the `balance` Variable can be declared after its use in the `show_balance` Function but the call to the main Function, the Function that calls the `show_balance` Function, must come after the `balance` Variable is defined.

# # Object = A "bundle" of related Attributes (Variables) and Methods (Functions), example: phone, cup, book. You need a Class to create multiple Objects, Class Instances, that all share that Class's structure and Methods.

# # Class = A blueprint used to design the structure and layout of an Object or Objects.

# # Method = A Function that is associated with a Class, i.e. belongs in an Object.

# class Car: # A Class is defined with the keyword `class` followed by the name of the Class, which is capitalized by convention
#     def __init__(self, model, year, color, for_sale): # This "Dunder Method", which is required to create Objects, is the Constructor Method of the Class, and to assign the Attributes that come after `self` we have to access `self` with `.` much like how Classes in JavaScript are constructed but using `self` instead of `this`...
#         self.model = model
#         self.year = year
#         self.color = color

#     def describe(self):
#         print(f'This is a {self.color} {self.model} from {self.year}')

#     # ...and since Classes take up a lot of space it's often convention for them to be defined in a separate file, then imported into the main file like `from <name of file containing the Class> import <name of Class>`, and then the Objects are created in the main file from that imported Class

# car1 = Car('Mustang', '2024', 'Red', False) # `self` is provided for use behind the scenes automatically, so in order to create the `car1` Object from the `Car` Class we simply call the `Car` Class like a Function and pass in the Arguments that the Constructor Method requires, which in this case is the `model`, `year`, `color`, and `for_sale` Attributes, to create the `car1` Object

# print(car1) # If we try and print this `car1` Object we'll get a memory address, which is the default behavior unless the __str__ Method in the Class from which the Object was created is defined, in which case `print` will return whatever is specified by that Method...

# print(car1.model) # ...but if we print any of the Attributes of the `car1` Object, e.g. `model`, we'll correctly get those Attributes

# class Student:

#     graduation_year = 2024 # `graduation_year` and `num_of_students` are Class Variables because they are defined outside of any Instance Methods so are shared among all Instances of the Class

#         Student.num_of_students += 1 # Knowing that any code inside our Constructor, i.e. this "Dunder init" part, is executed every time we instantiate an Object with the Class in question, we can add this Method that keeps track of the number of students (it does so by simply incrementing `num_of_students` by 1 each time a new Object is created), and to do this we have to maintain `num_of_students` inside the Class itself, i.e. as a Class Variable, not within `self`, i.e. not an Instance Variable

# student1 = Student('Spongebob', 30)
# student2 = Student('Patrick', 35)
# student3 = Student('Squidward', 55)
# student4 = Student('Sandy', 27)

# print(student1.name)
# print(student1.age)

# print(Student.graduation_year) # This is how you access a Class Variable directly, by using the Class name followed by a dot and the name of the Class Variable

# print(student1.graduation_year) # This is how you access a Class Variable through an Object. However, it is generally recommended to access or modify Class Variables directly through the Class itself to avoid confusion and maintain clarity.

# # Recap: With Multiple Inheritance you inherit from more than one Parent by simply adding that additional Class to the inheritance list, in this example adding both the `Predator` and `Prey` Classes to the `Fish` Class

# print(hawk1.eat()) # You can call the `eat` Method on Objects instantiated with the `Hawk` Class, because the `Hawk` Class inherits the `eat` Method from the `Animal` Class...

# # Recap: With Multilevel Inheritance you inherit from a Parent which inherits from another Parent, in this case the `Predator` and `Prey `Classes both inherit the `eat` and `sleep` Methods from the `Animal` Class, then the `Rabbit`, `Hawk` and `Fish` Classes all inheriting those Methods from the `Predator` and `Prey` Classes




# # The Super Function - 7:08:04

# # super() = A Function used in a Child Class to call Methods from a Parent Class, also known as the Superclass. It allows you to extend the functionality of inherited Methods. Within a Child Class, you can use it in a Constructor to assign Attributes common to all siblings, and in other Methods to call the Parent Class's method of the same name, which is useful for adding to the functionality of a Parent Class's Method without replacing it.

# from math import pi

#     def describe(self):

#     def __init__(self, color, is_filled, radius): # ...set up its Constructor Function to take the `Shape` Class's `color` and `is_filled` Attributes, as well as a unique radius Attribute...
#         super().__init__(color, is_filled) # ...and finally use the `super` Function to call the Constructor Function of the `Shape` Class, i.e. the Parent Class aka the Superclass, to pass in the `color` and `is_filled` Attributes...
#         self.radius = radius

#     def describe(self): # ...the `Circle` Class has access to the `Shape` Class's `describe` Method and, though a `describe` Method would be useful, the one inherited from the `Shape` Class isn't very useful so we can simply override it...

# # Polymorphism with Class Inheritance - 7:21:10

# # Polymorphism = Greek word that means "to have many forms or faces". Poly means "Many", Morph means "Form". In Python, and in programming in general, it refers to Methods/Functions/Operators with the same name that can be executed on many Objects or Classes (an example of a Python Function that can be used on different Objects is the `len` Function) and it can be achieved through Class Inheritance, as delineated in this lesson, or though Duck Typing, as explained in the next lesson.

# from math import pi
# from abc import ABC, @abstractmethod # `ABC` stands for Abstract Base Class, which is a Python Module that provides the infrastructure for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python, and the `@abstractmethod` Decorator is used to define an Abstract Method in an Abstract Class, which is a Class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be Subclassed


# class Shape: # This is only to show that the `Shape` Class is an Abstract Base Class, which is a Class that cannot be instantiated and is designed only to be Subclassed...
#     @abstractmethod # ...and this is how you define an Abstract Method in an Abstract Class
#     def area(self):
#         pass


# class Circle(Shape): # This is simply another example of Class inheritance
#     def __init__(self, radius):
#         self.radius = radius

#     def area(self):
#         return pi * self.radius ** 2
    

# class Square(Shape): # This is simply another example of Class inheritance
#     def __init__(self, side):
#         self.side = side

#     def area(self):
#         return self.side ** 2


# class Triangle(Shape): # This is simply another example of Class inheritance
#     def __init__(self, base, height):
#         self.base = base
#         self.height = height

#     def area(self):
#         return self.base * self.height * 0.5


# class Pizza(Circle): # This is another example of Class inheritance, but also an example of Multilevel Class Inheritance...
#     def __init__(self, topping, radius):
#         super().__init__(radius) # ...as well as use of the `super` Function to get the `area` Method from the `Circle` Class
#         self.topping = topping


# # `circle1`, `square1` and `triangle1` all have the `Shape` Class in common...
# circle1 = Circle(2)
# square1 = Square(1.5)
# triangle1 = Triangle(3, 4)

# shapes = [Circle(4), Square(5), Triangle(6, 7), Pizza('cheese', 8)] # ...and knowing this we can create a List of Class Instantiations and give it the name `shapes`

# # This is simply my generic helper Function to return the Class name and Properties to help with my example
# def get_instance_info(instance):
#     class_name = instance.__class__.__name__
#     properties = vars(instance)
#     return f'{class_name} Properties: {properties}'

# for shape in shapes: # We can iterate over the `shapes` List...
#     print(shape.area()) # ...calling the `area` Method on each `shape`, which is an example of Polymorphism because though `shapes` all have the `area` Method in common it's implemented differently in each Class (except for `Pizza` Class which directly inherits the `area` Method from the `Circle` class)...
#     print(get_instance_info(shape)) # ...and just to show the unique Properties of each `shape` we can call the `get_instance_info` Function on each `shape`




# # Polymorphism with Duck Typing - 7:29:15

# # Duck Typing = Another way to achieve Polymorphism besides Class Inheritance. Object must have the minimum necessary Attributes and/or Methods to be used in a certain context, like the adage "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck".

# class Animal:
#     alive = True

# class Dog(Animal):
#     def favorite_quote(self):
#         return 'Woof'

# class Cat(Animal):
#     def favorite_quote(self):
#         return 'Meow'

# class Car:
#     def favorite_quote(self):
#         return 'Honk'

# animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Car()] # As an aside, because we don't have necessary Attributes required for either of these Classes we don't need to pass any Arguments to either of the Classes in this List in order to instantiate them

# for animal in animals: # We can simply loop through the List of instantiated Classes...
#     print(animal.favorite_quote()) # ...and call the `favorite_quote` Method, and if we were to stop there we might think that a `Car` is also an `Animal` (i.e. "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck")...

# for animal in animals: # ...until we try it again...
#     print(animal.favorite_quote())
#     print(animal.alive) # ...this time printing the `alive` Attribute, which is only present in the `Animal` Class, and discover we get the error "AttributeError: 'Car' object has no Attribute 'alive'" then learning that the `Car` Class doesn't have the minimum necessary Attributes and/or Methods to be used in the context of the `Animal` Class, so it's not an `Animal`, even though it shares the `favorite_quote` Method with both the `Dog` and `Cat` Classes (note, if we were to simply set an `alive` Attribute directly in the `Car` Class and make it `False` the `Car` Class, according to Duck Typing, would then technically classify as being also in the `Animal` Class)




# # Static Methods vs Instance Methods - 7:33:34

# # Static Method = A Method that belongs to a Class rather than to any Object from that Class, i.e rather than from any Class Instance. Static Methods do not require an Instance of the Class to be called and are typically used for operations that are relevant to all Instances of the Class or for utility Functions. Static Methods never have the `self` Parameter.

# # Instance Method = A Method that belongs to an Object from a Class, i.e. from a Class Instance. Instance Methods require an instance of the Class to be called and can access and modify the Attributes of the Instance. Instance Methods always have the `self` Parameter.

# class Employee:

#     def __init__(self, name, position):
#         self.name = name
#         self.position = position

#     def get_info(self): # `get_info` is an Instance Method because it takes the `self` Parameter, which is a reference to the Object that is calling the Method
#         return f'{self.name} = {self.position}'

#     @staticmethod # Static Methods take the `@staticmethod` Decorator, a built-in Python Decorator that is used to define a Static Method...
#     def is_valid_position(position): # ...and they don't take the `self` Parameter, meaning they don't have access to the Object's Attributes, thus are used for operations shared by all Instances of the Class
#         valid_positions = ['Manager', 'Cashier', 'Cook', 'Janitor']
#         return position in valid_positions

# # Because Static Methods don't have access to any Instance-specific data you can simply call the Class itself followed by a dot and the name of the Static Method. The Arguments passed to the Static Method can come from anywhere including Instances of the Class, but it's not required.
# is_cook_a_valid_position = Employee.is_valid_position('Cook')
# is_rocket_scientist_a_valid_position = Employee.is_valid_position('Rocket Scientist')

# print(f'It is {is_cook_a_valid_position} that a Cook is a valid position')
# print(f'Is is {is_rocket_scientist_a_valid_position} that a Rocket Scientist is a valid position')

# employee1 = Employee('Eugene', 'Manager')
# employee2 = Employee('Squidward', 'Cashier')
# employee3 = Employee('Spongebob', 'Cook')

# # To call an Instance Method we have to access one of the Instances of the Class in order to use it...

# # ...so to get the employee info on `employee1`, `employee2` and `employee3` we have to access the `get_info` Method on those Instances of the Employee Method
# print(f'{employee1.get_info()}')
# print(f'{employee2.get_info()}')
# print(f'{employee3.get_info()}')

# # Recap: For an Instance Method you must access it through an Object created from a Class, whereas for a Static Method you can access it directly from the Class and don't even need to create any Object(s) from that Class




# # Class Method - 7:39:31

# # Class Methods = Methods that involve Class level data and allow operations related to the Class itself. They take `cls` as the first Parameter which represents the Class itself.

# class Student:

#     count = 0 # `count` and `total_gpa` are a Class Variables
#     total_gpa = 0

#     def __init__(self, name, gpa): # The Constructor Method has two Parameters, `name` and `gpa`, beyond the default `self` Parameter
#         self.name = name
#         self.gpa = gpa

#         Student.count += 1 # The Class Variable called `count` is incremented by 1 each time a new Object is created, which we can do here in the Constructor Method
#         Student.total_gpa += gpa # The Class Variable called `total_gpa` is incremented by the `gpa` of each new Object when one is created, which we can do here in the Constructor Method

#     def get_info(self): # `get_info` is an Instance Method (we know immediately because it takes the `self` Parameter)
#         return f'{self.name} has a GPA of {self.gpa}'

#     @classmethod # Class Methods like `get_count` take the `@classmethod` Decorator above them, a built-in Python Decorator that is used to define a Class Method, and rather than having `self` as the first Parameter they take `cls` as the first Parameter, representing the Class itself
#     def get_count(cls):
#         return f'Total number of students: {cls.count}'

#     @classmethod # `get_average_gpa` is also a Class Method
#     def get_average_gpa(cls):
#         if cls.count == 0:
#             return 0
#         else:
#             return f'The average GPA is: {cls.total_gpa / cls.count:.2f}'

# student1 = Student('Spongebob', 3.2)
# student1 = Student('Patrick', 2.0)
# student1 = Student('Sandy', 4.0)

# print(f'What is the total number of students? {Student.get_count()}')
# print(f'What is the average GPA? {Student.get_average_gpa()}')




# # Magic Methods - 7:46:17

# # Magic Methods = Dunder Methods (double underscore Methods) such as `__init__`, `__name__`, `__str__`, `__eq__`, typically found in Classes, which are automatically called using Python's built-in operations. They allow developers to define or customize the behavior of Objects.

# class Book:
#     def __init__(self, title, author, num_pages): # `__init__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to initialize an Object with the Attributes passed in (and it's required to create Objects)
#         self.title = title
#         self.author = author
#         self.num_pages = num_pages

#     def __str__(self): # `__str__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to return a String representation of the Object however we want to, rather than the default memory address, so that doing something like `print(book1)` will return the `title` and `author` of the book rather than something like `<__main__.Book object at 0x1025ad400>`
#         return f'{self.title} by {self.author}'

#     def __eq__(self, other): # `__eq__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to compare two Objects, in this case we're comparing the `title` and `author` of two books to see if they're the same, where the `other` Parameter is the other book (note we're not also comparing `num_pages` in this `__eq__` Magic Method because font sizes might be different between the two books, which would increase `num_pages` of what should be considered the same book)
#         return self.title == other.title and self.author == other.author

#     def __lt__(self, other): # `__lt__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to customize the behavior of the `<` Logical Operator, in this case we're comparing the `num_pages` between two books
#         return self.num_pages < other.num_pages

#     def __add__(self, other): # `__add__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to customize the behavior of the `+` Operator, in this case we're adding the `num_pages` of two books
#         return self.num_pages + other.num_pages

#     def __contains__(self, keyword): # `__contains__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to customize the behavior of the `in` Operator, in this case we're checking if a `keyword` is in the `title` of the book
#         return keyword in self.title

#     def __getitem__(self, key): # `__getitem__` is a Dunder Method that allows us to customize the behavior of the `[]` Operator, in this case we're getting the `title` of the book
#         if key == 'title':
#             return self.title
#         elif key == 'author':
#             return self.author
#         elif key == 'num_pages':
#             return self.num_pages
#         else:
#             return f'{key} not found'

# book1 = Book('The Hobbit', 'J.R.R. Tolkien', 310)
# book2 = Book('The Hobbit', 'J.R.R. Tolkien', 375) # `book2` is intentionally the same as `book1`, but with different `num_pages`, to demonstrate how our `__eq__` Dunder Method works
# book3 = Book('Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone', 'J.K. Rowling', 223)
# book4 = Book('The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', 'C.S. Lewis', 172)

# print(book3) # The `title` and `author` of the book will be printed rather than the memory address because we used the `__str__` Dunder Method when creating the `Book` Class

# print(book1 == book2) # `True` will be printed because the Comparison Operator is using the `__eq__` Dunder Method in our `Book` Class, which compares the `title` and `author` of the two books, rather than `False`, which would otherwise happen because the memory addresses are different

# print(book4 < book3) # `True` will be printed because the Comparison Operator is using the `__lt__` Dunder Method in our `Book` Class, which compares the `num_pages` of the two books, rather than getting the error "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Book' and 'Book'"

# print(book3 + book4) # 395 will be printed because the `+` Operator is using the `__add__` Dunder Method in our `Book` Class, which adds the `num_pages` of the two books, rather than getting the error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Book' and 'Book'"

# print('Lion' in book4) # `True` will be printed because the word "Lion" is in the `title` of the book, which is checked by the `__contains__` Dunder Method in our `Book` Class, rather than getting the error "TypeError: argument of type 'Book' is not iterable"

# print(f'Title is: {book2['title']}, Author is: {book2['author']}, Number of Pages are: {book2['num_pages']}, Pizza: {book2['pizza']}') # We get "Title is: The Hobbit, Author is: J.R.R. Tolkien, Number of Pages are: 375, Pizza: pizza not found" because the `[]` Operator is using the `__getitem__` Dunder Method in our `Book` Class, which gets the `key` passed to it and returns the appropriate assigned Attribute, rather than getting the error "TypeError: 'Book' object is not subscriptable"




# # @property Decorator - 7:59:52

# # @property Decorator = The built-in Python `@property` Decorator is used to define a Method as a Property, meaning it can be accessed like an Attribute, which gives the ability to add additional logic when reading, writing or deleting Attributes. It gives us a `getter` Method, a `setter` Method, and a `deleter` Method.

# class Rectangle:
#     def __init__(self, width, height):
#         self._width = width # Prefixing an Attribute with an underscore is a convention to indicate that it's a Private Attribute, meaning it should not be accessed externally, i.e from outside the Class (although it still can be)
#         self._height = height

#     @property # The `@property` Decorator can then be used to access a Private Attribute internally, i.e. from inside the Class, and to do something with it first...
#     def width(self): # ...so this `getter` Method of the `@property` Decorator, called `width`...
#         return f'{self._width:.1f}cm' # ..accesses the internal `_width` and returns it as a String with one decimal place

#     @property
#     def height(self):
#         return f'{self._height:.1f}cm'

#     @width.setter # Unlike the `getter` Method (demonstrated above) the `setter` Method must be deliberately called on the Property in question...
#     def width(self, new_width): # ...and we don't want the Parameter name passed to this `width` Method to be the same as the Method name, `width`, that's the only reason we're naming it to something different, i.e `new_width`...
#         if new_width > 0:
#             self._width = new_width
#         else: # ...so now if a user were to instantiate an Object from `Rectangle`, called `rectangle1`, and then try to do `rectangle1.width = 0` to later set the `width` to 0 (or to try and set the `width` to a negative number) the `width` wouldn't set on their Instance of the `Rectangle` class, and instead they'd get this "Width must be greater than zero" message
#             print('Width must be greater than zero') 

#     @height.setter
#     def height(self, new_height):

#     def height(self):
#         del self._height
#         print('Height has been deleted')

# rectangle1.width = 0 # ...try to later set the `width` to 0 and get the message from the `setter` Method that this won't work...

# rectangle1.width = 5 # ...then try to set the `width` to 5...

# print(rectangle1.width) # ...and print the `width` to see that it does indeed work, and also see that the `@property` Decorator has allowed us to change the raw Attributes...

# print(rectangle1._width) # ...but that we can still access the Attributes...

# del rectangle1.width # ...and finally that we can delete the Attributes...

# print(rectangle1.width) # ...as confirmed here when trying to print the `width` after it's been deleted, which should now throw "AttributeError: 'Rectangle' object has no attribute '_width'. Did you mean: 'width'?"




# # Decorators - 8:07:34

# # Decorator = A Function that extends the behavior of another Function without modifying the Base Function, by passing the Base Function as an Argument to the Decorator.

# def add_sprinkles(func):
#     def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): # The `wrapper` to call the Base Function is crucial to the Decorator Function otherwise the Base Function would be called as soon as we were to apply the Decorator and, if the Base Function takes any Arguments, the `wrapper` should be set up to take any number of Arguments or Keyword Arguments as demonstrated here
#         print('You added sprinkles') # This `wrapper` Function prints that sprinkles were added...
#         func(*args, **kwargs) # ...and then calls the Base Function

# with open(file=file_path, mode='w') as file: # This is an example of how to write a `txt` file, where `mode` is set as a Default Argument to `w` for "write" and the file is opened with Python's native `open` Function, which takes the `file` (the File Path, as as a Default Argument in this example) and the `mode` as Arguments. The `with` Statement preceding the `open` Function is a context manager which facilitates closing the file when we're done so we don't have to worry about doing that manually. We don't need to specify the Arguments as Default Arguments, I'm just doing so for the example. The `open` Function returns a file Object, the first Parameter being the `file` (the File Path), the second Parameter being the `mode`, which can be set to `w`, `x`, `a` or `r`, where `x` will throw an error if the file already exists and `w` will work, regardless. The keyword `as` signifies instantiation of the Object which, in this case, is Python's built-in `file` Object (which just happens to be in lowercase, though it is indeed a Class)

# import pygame # This Module allows us to work with sound effects. If it's not already installed try doing `pip3 install pygame`. If that doesn't work it's likely because `homebrew`, the unofficial package manager for macOS, is restricting it in which case you must install `pygame` in a virtual environment. The way to do this is to first create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv <folder-name-for-virtual-environment>`, where `python3 -m venv venv` is usually the convention, which creates a new directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment. Then, in order to activate the virtual environment, do `source venv/bin/activate`. And finally, to install `pygame` in the virtual environment, do `pip3 install pygame`

# # Every time a `pygame` is imported it prints a message to the console "pygame 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.13.0) Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html", which is annoying. To to suppress that we have to go to the `venv` folder, find the ` lib/python3.13/site-packages/pygame/__init__.py` file and comment out the `if` Statement that begins with `if "PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT" not in os.environ`

# # Multithreading  - 9:05:04

# # Multithreading = Is used to perform multiple tasks concurrently (multitasking), which is good for I/O bound tasks like reading files or fetching data from APIs, similar to `async/await` in JavaScript. It's used by accessing the `threading` Module and then calling the `Thread` Constructor on it and passing in the `target` Function. For example `threading.Thread(target=my_function)`.

# import threading # Import the `threading` Module
# import time # Import the `time` Module (to help us simulate a chore taking a specified amount of time to complete)

# def walk_dog():
#     time.sleep(8) # Make this Function take 8 seconds to complete

#     time.sleep(4) #
#     print(f'You finish getting the mail from {location}')

# # If you were to do...

# # walk_dog()
# # take_out_trash()
# # get_mail('Locust Street Post Office')

# # ...it would print...

# # You finish walking the dog
# # You finish taking out the trash
# # You finish getting the mail from Locust Street Post Office

# # ...with each chore taking 8, 2 and 4 seconds respectively, the total time to complete all three chores being 14 seconds because all three functions are running on the same Thread (the Main Thread)...

# # ...so to Multithread these...

# chore1 = threading.Thread(target=walk_dog) # ...create a new Thread called `chore1` and call the `Thread` Constructor on the `threading` Module passing in the `walk_dog` Function, which must be a Keyword Argument...
# chore1.start() # ...then call the `start` Method on the `chore1` Thread, then do the same for the `take_out_trash` and `get_mail` Functions...
# chore2 = threading.Thread(target=take_out_trash)
# chore2.start()
# chore3 = threading.Thread(target=get_mail, args=('Locust Street Post Office',)) # ...and if the Function takes a Parameter, like this `get_mail` Function, you have to pass it as a Tuple to the `args` Parameter and, in order to correctly designate it as a Tuple, when there's only one `arg` you have to put a comma after the Parameter...
# chore3.start()

# chore1.join() # ...then call the `join` Method on each of the Threads to wait for them to finish before moving on to the next Thread...
# chore2.join()
# chore3.join()

# print('All chores are complete!') # ...and finally print "All chores are complete!", which will only print after all three Threads have finished running because the `join` Method was called on each of them...


# # This should print...

# # You finish taking out the trash
# # You finish getting the mail from Locust Street Post Office
# # You finish walking the dog
# # All chores are complete!

# # ...with each chore taking 2, 4 and 8 seconds respectively, completing in a different order than they were executed, where the total time to complete all three chores is merely equal to the time it takes to complete the longest chore (`walk_dog` of 8 seconds) because each chore is running on its own Thread

From the `PyQt5` Module we access the `QtWidgets` Submodule to import the `QApplication`, `QWidget`, `QLabel` and `QVBoxLayout` Classes, where `QVBoxLayout` is our layout manager
# from PyQt5.QtCore import QTimer, QTime, Qt # From the `PyQt5` Module we access the QtCore Submodule to import the `QTimer`, `QTime` and `Qt` Classes, where `QTimer` is a Class that provides repetitive and single-shot timers, `QTime` is a Class that provides clock time Functions, and `Qt` is a Class that provides a set of common non-GUI functionality

# # Note, if installing `PyQt5 doesn't work it's likely because `homebrew`, the unofficial package manager for macOS, is restricting it in which case you must install `PyQt5` in a virtual environment. The way to do this is to first create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv <folder-name-for-virtual-environment>`, where `python3 -m venv venv` is usually the convention, which creates a new directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment. Then, in order to activate the virtual environment, do `source venv/bin/activate`. And finally, to install `PyQt5` in the virtual environment, do `pip3 install PyQt5`

In this case the Method we're calling (which we're "chaining" on) is `__init__`, namely the Constructor of `QWidget` itself, i.e. the Constructor of the Parent Class of `WeatherApp`. When we create a Class that inherits from a Parent Class we often want to initialize the Parent Class as well because it might have some important setup code that needs to run. The `super()` Function returns a temporary Object of the Superclass that allows us to call its Methods, and the the `__init__` Method, the special Method in Python Classes known as a Constructor, is automatically called when an instance of the Class is created. In this case, `super().__init__()` is calling the Constructor of `QWidget`, which currently has no Arguments.

We can't call a `setAlignment` Method on our `self.get_weather_button` because it's an instance of the `QPushButton` Class which, unlike `QLabel` and `QLineEdit` Classes, doesn't have built-in support for text alignment hence lacks a `setAlignment` or similar Method. We don't need to center it because it's the widest subwidget we have so it already takes up the entire width of the window, but if we'd needed to we'd have to use a horizontal layout manager, i.e. QHBoxLayout

# import requests # The `requests` Module allows us to send HTTP requests using Python
# from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout # From the `PyQt5` Module we access the `QtWidgets` Submodule to import the `QApplication`, `QWidget`, `QLabel`, `QPushButton`, `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` Classes where `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` are layout managers that together work like CSS Flexbox

# # Note, if installing `PyQt5 doesn't work it's likely because `homebrew`, the unofficial package manager for macOS, is restricting it in which case you must install `PyQt5` in a virtual environment. The way to do this is to first create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv <folder-name-for-virtual-environment>`, where `python3 -m venv venv` is usually the convention, which creates a new directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment. Then, in order to activate the virtual environment, do `source venv/bin/activate`. And finally, to install `PyQt5` in the virtual environment, do `pip3 install PyQt5`
